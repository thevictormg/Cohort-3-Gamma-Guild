Blockchain Infrastructure, Distributed Ledgers, and How NFTs and Tokens Change Ownership
Week 1 Day 2 Assignment
Student: Victor Morgan
Overview
This report explores blockchain infrastructure, distributed ledgers, and how NFTs and tokens influence digital ownership. It includes research on five blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Polkadot), compares distributed ledgers versus blockchains, analyzes NFTs and fungible tokens using real-world examples, provides comparison tables, and presents summarized insights.


Blockchain Research
Blockchain	Node Types	Popular Clients	Consensus Mechanism
Bitcoin: Full nodes, SPV nodes, miners	Bitcoin Core	Proof of Work (SHA-256)
Ethereum	Validators, execution & consensus nodes	Geth, Prysm, Lighthouse, Teku	Proof of Stake (Beacon Chain)
Solana	Validators, RPC/entry nodes	solana-validator	Proof of History + Tower BFT
Cardano	Relay, block-producing, light nodes	cardano-node	Ouroboros PoS (Praos/TPraos)
Polkadot	Validators, collators, full nodes	Substrate-based clients	BABE + GRANDPA (NPoS)

 
Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) vs Blockchain
While all blockchains are distributed ledgers, not all distributed ledgers are blockchains. DLT is a broader term for systems where data is shared and synchronized across nodes. Blockchains store data in chained blocks and are often public and permissionless, while DLTs may be permissioned and use other data structures.

NFTs vs Fungible Tokens
Fungible tokens are interchangeable digital assets (e.g., USDT, USDC), whereas non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique and represent specific digital or physical assets (e.g., BAYC, CryptoKitties). Ownership of an NFT means ownership of the token itself, not necessarily the intellectual property rights to the associated media.
Examples of NFTs: CryptoKitties, Bored Ape Yacht Club, NBA Top Shot, Beeple's 'Everydays', Tarantino NFT cases 
Examples of Fungible Tokens: USDT, USDC, DAI, UNI, ApeCoin.
